# VueLamp JavaScript Explanation

## Code Overview
```javascript
var btn = document.getElementById("btn");
var light = document.getElementById("light");
function toggleBtn(){
    btn.classList.toggle("active"); 
    light.classList.toggle("on");
}
```

## Line-by-Line Explanation

1. `var btn = document.getElementById("btn");`
   - Gets the button element from HTML using its ID "btn"
   - This button will be used as the light switch

2. `var light = document.getElementById("light");`
   - Gets the light image element using its ID "light"
   - This is the element that will show/hide the light effect

3. `function toggleBtn() { ... }`
   - This function runs when the button is clicked
   - It handles the switching effect for both button and light

4. `btn.classList.toggle("active");`
   - Toggles the "active" class on the button
   - When active, the button's appearance changes to show it's pressed

5. `light.classList.toggle("on");`
   - Toggles the "on" class on the light image
   - When the "on" class is present, the light effect is visible

The toggle functionality uses CSS classes to switch between states, making it smooth and efficient.


Whaat saad Changed ? 

Errors ::

There's a typo in getElementById (it's written as getElementbyId)
The light toggle is using incorrect syntax: classList.on("on") should be classList.toggle("on")
The light variable is not properly defined

Fixes :: 

I've fixed the following issues in the JavaScript code:

Corrected getElementbyId to getElementById
Properly defined the light variable by getting the element with ID "light"
Changed classList.on("on") to classList.toggle("on")
The toggle button should now work correctly. When clicked, it will:

Toggle the "active" class on the button
Toggle the "on" class on the light image
